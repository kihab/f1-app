### Frontend

- **Purpose:** Native iOS app for browsing F1 World Champions and race results.
- **Who it serves:** End users (iPhone/iPad).
- **Tech stack:** Swift & SwiftUI.
- **Why:** Fastest to bootstrap with zero learning curve, deeply familiar for developer, native performance and integration.
- **Alternatives considered:** React (too much learning), Flutter (new language and setup), React Native (not native-feeling).
