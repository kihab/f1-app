## Special Features

### Champion Highlighting

Champion races (where the winner was the season champion) receive special visual treatment:
1. Orange accent bar on the left side of the row
2. Trophy emoji in the top-right corner
3. Winner name shown in bold orange text

This multi-layered approach makes champion races immediately distinguishable.

### Country/Nationality Representation

Flag emojis provide a visual identifier for countries and nationalities, improving scanability and adding visual interest without requiring image assets.

### Internationalization

The app is structured to support multiple languages in the future:
- All user-facing strings are organized in a dedicated localization system
- Context-based organization (Home, Races, Loading, Errors)
- Text messages support parameterization for dynamic content

### Design Constants

The app maintains design consistency through a centralized constants system:
- Standardized spacing values (small: 8pt, standard: 16pt, etc.)
- Consistent corner radius (8pt)
- Defined accent colors and styling metrics
- Centralized asset names
